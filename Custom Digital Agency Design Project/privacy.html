                        <h4 class="swan_pp_h4">Security Policy</h4>
                        <p>TenPlus Digital Labs is committed to maintaining high security standards to protect the data
                           of all parties who interact with our information systems. No data transmission across the
                           Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. TenPlus
                           Digital Labs takes several measures to minimize any risk and to protect your data and your
                           business.</p>
                        <h4 class="swan_pp_h4">Encryption</h4>
                        <p>TenPlus Digital Labs employs encryption technologies using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) from
                           trusted vendors like Verisign and Thawte to encrypt sensitive data between and among you and
                           our systems. TenPlus Digital Labs also uses strong proprietary encryption methodologies to
                           store and maintain particularly sensitive personal or financial information.</p>
                        <h4 class="swan_pp_h4">Authentication</h4>
                        <p>TenPlus Digital Labs recognizes how important our security best practices are to your
                           business. Unlike many other websites, TenPlus Digital Labs chooses your password and assigns
                           it to you. Thanks to our encryption methodologies, your TenPlus Digital Labs password cannot
                           be viewed or discovered, even by our own staff. Other web sites may permit you to choose a
                           password but may require special characters, formats, or numbers. TenPlus Digital Labs's
                           password policy ensures that your password is strong and unique. Unlike other website
                           passwords you may use, your TenPlus Digital Labs password cannot be discovered from your
                           personal data or activity on other web sites. While this authentication practice may at times
                           seem cumbersome, it is in place to protect you, your data, and your business.</p>
                        <h4 class="swan_pp_h4">Infrastructure Technology</h4>
                        <p>TenPlus Digital Labs chooses technologies, vendors, and partners that exhibit good security
                           practices. Defense strategies are employed with inclusion-based rules and only permit known
                           and acceptable activities from expected or trusted entities. TenPlus Digital Labs maintains
                           reasonable physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with pertinent
                           statutes to protect your sensitive information.</p>
                        <h4 class="swan_pp_h4">Aggressive Fraud Analysis</h4>
                        <p>TenPlus Digital Labs automatically collects and interrogates the activities of all IP
                           addresses that interact with TenPlus Digital Labs systems. Suspicious or fraudulent behavior
                           is dealt with immediately and directly using proprietary systems and procedures. In addition,
                           vendors must submit their account and product for approval to our security department before
                           it can be published to the Marketplace and sold. These practices help us to maintain higher
                           satisfaction rates and lower costs.</p>
                        <h4 class="swan_pp_h4">Comments and Questions</h4>
                        <p>If you have any questions, comments or concerns about our Security Procedures, you may submit
                           your inquiry to our Customer Service department.</p>
